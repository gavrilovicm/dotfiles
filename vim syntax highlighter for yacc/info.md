# Vim sintax highlighter for Yacc

Sintax highlighter for .y files I use for *Vim* on my Ubuntu 16.04.

## Where to put yacc.vim?

You copy it into your syntax folder under **/usr/share/vim**. 
At the time I am writing this my **yacc.vim** file destination is under **/usr/share/vim/vim74/syntax**. 
It may be **vim72** folder depending on distribution of ubuntu you are using.
If you already have **yacc.vim** file you can just replace it with whis one.
